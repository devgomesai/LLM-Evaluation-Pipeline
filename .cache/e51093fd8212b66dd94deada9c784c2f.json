{"prompt": "\nGiven the following claim and the provided context, determine if the claim is supported by the context.\nAnswer with one of the following: SUPPORTED, UNSUPPORTED, CONTRADICTED.\n\nClaim: This helps ensure the health of the eggs used in the IVF cycle.\nContext: Donor Egg IVF IVF is a boon for infertile couples who are longing to have a baby. In most instances, it becomes the last resort for these couples, but one that has a significantly high success rate. When a couple comes to us for treatment, and after the first tests and workup has been done, we are able to identify whether the woman and the man have healthy eggs and sperm respectively, in order to be able to conceive via IVF.In case it is found that the quality of the woman\u2019s egg is poor or if the woman doesn\u2019t have any eggs at all, it\u2019s possible for the couple to use donor eggs in their IVF treatment. Other third party reproduction options such as donor sperm, donor embryo and surrogacy are also now being used by couples who are unable to conceive with their own eggs or sperm.Of course, adoption is another course of action for couples that want to have a baby. However, there are times when a woman wants to experience pregnancy and wants to breast-feed her child and go through the early newborn- bonding process- these things aren\u2019t possible with options such as surrogacy and adoption. Take a look at how the donor egg process works.Donor EggsSome women are unable to conceive using their own eggs for a range of reasons.Age-related ovarian failurePremature ovarian failureSurgery for specific pelvic disordersMedical therapies such as chemotherapyIf after the relevant tests, we have identified that the patient is unable to conceive because of any of these reasons, we may discuss the egg donor option with the patient. The donor eggs that are used in the treatment may be obtained via:An anonymous donorThrough an egg bankKnown donor (friend or sister etc)If the patient opts for eggs from an anonymous donor, it takes some time to identify the right donor; once that is taken care of; we then have to synchronize the donor and the recipient cycles.The Pros and ConsIn the egg bank option, the eggs are ready for use and it makes the process quicker. Both these options have their pros and cons. We prefer using frozen eggs, as there are certain risks associated with using fresh eggs. For example, the donor may not respond to the medications as we expect, and she may not be able to produce the number of high quality eggs that are required. In some instances, the donor may just decide she wants to drop-out mid cycle. Our pregnancy rates with frozen eggs from our egg bank are as good as with fresh eggs, since we vitrify these eggs, which means they all survive intact after thawing. Another major advantage of using donor eggs means we don\u2019t need to bother to synchronise the cycles of the donor and the recipient, since the eggs can be used according to the patient\u2019s cycle. Egg Donor Procedure \u2013 What Tests Does the Donor Require Using an egg donor for IVF treatments is not unheard of anymore. With the number of women willing to donate their eggs for IVF treatments on the rise and the number of women aged above 40 wanting to have babies rising, clinics are increasingly engaging in egg donor procedure for IVF.Matching the CycleThough some clinics would have you believe that using an egg donor is immensely easier than using your own eggs for an IVF cycle, the truth is that the egg donor procedure for IVF is not all too simple either. In fact, matching the donor's cycle with your own is of critical importance and so it is to ascertain that the donor's eggs are healthy enough to be used. Why is Screening of Eggs Necessary?In any IVF cycle, where the eggs are donated \u2013 by a friend or a relative or by an anonymous donor, a thorough evaluation and screening of each donor is absolutely essential. The screening is performed to ensure that the eggs being used for the IVF treatment would in fact, be useful for the treatment. If the eggs in the donor were of poor quality too, the IVF treatment would fail.The donor should also be made aware of all the egg donor procedure so that she can make an informed choice about the donation. She should be given the option to back out if she has any doubts or concerns. The evaluation and screening of the potential egg donor should ideally serve to protect all the parties \u2013 the recipient, the donor and the offspring resulting from the donation.

IVF with Donor Eggs \u2013 a difficult emotional dilemma The doctor will select a donor for you who matches your physical traits ( height, colour of eyes, hair and blood group, for example). Once the donor's egg are mature, she will have to go through the egg retrieval process. She will be superovulated to harvest many eggs in one cycle. These eggs are frozen, which means they can be thawed, fertilised with your husband's sperm, and the resulting embryos then transferred into your uterus when your uterine lining is receptive. The spare embryos can be frozen and then used in the future as needed.SummaryHaving an IVF with donor eggs is common, especially when the woman is past the age of 40 or she has unusable eggs.
